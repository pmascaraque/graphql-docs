In a world of services, microservices, dtos, endpoints, servers and APIs, the curiosity has overwhelmed me to set up a fully functioning API following documentation and troubleshooting with my friends. 

Please follow me in this journey as I document my migraines with PR's, and join the ![discussion]() for each individual repo and feel free to ![contribute]() 

I'll be using Ben awads videos and the techs main docs as tools, perhaps adapting to the time that has passed, such as Prisma v2 coming out or Vercel's overwhelming success and simplicity.
