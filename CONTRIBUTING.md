# Contributing

## [Branches]()

### Feel free to submit changes directly to the main branch.

We only use branches when co-working, but we do our best to keep main in good shape, with all tests passing to aid with [continuous deployment]().

# [Features]()

## [Asking for a feature]()

### If you don't feel confident to make a PR and document it, either [joining the discussion]() or [correctly asking]() [somebody]() to contribute can be as powerful as contributing itself.

Formatting either a question, an elevator pitch or a client demo, can be quite challenging, but passing the ball perfectly is why at 120 minutes, the [dutch ;)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmVstWkIpY0&ab_channel=warofchampions) aren't world champions (I love you Holland). Football comparisons aside, developing is often a team effort, its important to document every step of the way.

## [Adding Features]()

### Honestly, with the fact that you're even reading this far down, just make the PR, you can lurk on our [linting preferences](), or you can make a PR and we can lint the branch.

# [Bugs]()

## [Submitting or Fixing a bug]()

### 3^. Fix our bugs :).
